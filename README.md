# Sameer Tulshyan's Personal Website
This webpage was built as a way to showcase my relevant experience to potential employers. It includes links to my GitHub(where you are now!), Linkedin and Resume. It also showcases some of my more visually-appealing projects.

## Tools
The webpage was built using Bootstrap for a mobile-first, responsive design. Some basic JS functionality was added using jQuery.
