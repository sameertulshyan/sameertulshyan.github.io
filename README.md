# Sameer Tulshyan's Personal Website
This webpage was built as a way to showcase my relevant experience to potential employers. It includes links to my GitHub(where you are now!), Linkedin and Resume. It also showcases a selection of my projects.

## Tools
The webpage was built using HTML, CSS and JS. The Maginific pop-up script for jQuery was used to provide the image lightbox functionality for the projects section.
