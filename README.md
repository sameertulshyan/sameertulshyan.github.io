# Sameer Tulshyan's Personal Website
This webpage was built as a way to showcase my relevant experience to potential employers. It includes links to my GitHub(where you are now!), Linkedin and Resume. It also displays a selection of my projects.

## Tools
The webpage was built using HTML, CSS and JS. The [Magnific pop-up script](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) for jQuery was used to provide image lightbox functionality for the projects section.
